This project is a Windows-based calculator application developed in C++. It provides essential arithmetic functions, a clean user interface, and a "Trace Logic" tab to log decision points, making it easy to track and debug operations. 

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes buttons for digits (0-9), basic operators, and utility functions such as clear (C) and clear entry (CE).
- **Trace Logic Tab**: Logs decision points and displays them in a list format, allowing users to follow the sequence of operations in real-time.
- **Toggleable Tracing**: Enables or disables logging to the trace panel with "Intro Trace On" and "Intro Trace Off" buttons.
